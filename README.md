# Google-capstone-bellabeat-analysis
Tableau dashboard and analysis from the Google Data Analytics Capstone project. Focused on user behavior insights from Fitbit data.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- High caloric burn ≠ high distance traveled
- Sedentary time does not always correlate with low energy output
- Users' total distance dropped by ~45% from April to May
- Personalized insights are more valuable than general activity goals

## 📊 Tools Used
- Tableau (for data visualization)
- Power BI (for data visualization)
- Google Sheets (for initial data cleaning)

I created visual dashboards using both **Tableau** and **Power BI** to compare trends across **April and May**, focusing on the top 5 users by total distance.
  
## 📁 Included Files
- Tableau dashboard screenshots
- Power BI dashboard pdf file
